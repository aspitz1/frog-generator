# Frog Generator
This cute app will match you with a frog based on the first letter of your first name. It will display the type of frog you've been matched with, and a cute little image (made by me, Anna Spitz!) :frog:
## How it's Made
The output is based on an array of 26 items. There is a `eventListener` that uses a function to take the input value at 0 and turn it into a capital letter in order to use its charset - 65 to call a value in the array.
